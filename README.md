### Stroke me

Simple [GLSL demo](https://github.com/vilkastakan/generative/blob/master/stroke_me.fs) previously used on [my website](https://vlks.tk). Also [second (more glitchy and with balanced colors) part](https://github.com/vilkastakan/generative/blob/master/stroke_me_v2.fs) is available.

Both parts can be played by [glslViewer](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslViewer).

### async

`23 Jan 2021`

This work is about asynchronous communication and meta-questions. Kudos to [nohello.com](https://www.nohello.com/) and [nometa.xyz](https://nometa.xyz/) and regrets to people that can't understand easy rules.
